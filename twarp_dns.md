# Notice of Right to Opt Out of “Sale” of Personal Information

Beginning January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“**CCPA**”) provides California residents with certain rights with respect to their personal information, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of personal information as explained below.

Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our EULA and Privacy Policy. 

- The Company collects information from or about you, including personal information, when you use our App and Services as described in our [Privacy Policy](/twarp/privacy).
- We may disclose certain information we collect about you for purposes that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. For example, we may disclose information to advertising partners, advertising technology companies, and companies that perform advertising-related services in order to provide you with more relevant advertising tailored to your interests on our App. We may also disclose to our service providers information about you, which may help personalize your experience and the content and ads you see thought your use of the App as well as other services, as further described in our Privacy Policy.

- You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. 
- Please note that this opt-out will apply on a going forward basis with respect to our disclosure of information. Even if you opt out, you will continue to receive ads on our App, which may not be as tailored to your interests.

In addition to providing you the ability to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information under CCPA as described above, you have additional controls and choices with respect to the collection and use of your information by third parties:

- Some of the third parties that collect information from or about you on the App in order to provide more relevant advertising to your participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“**DAA**”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising or may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“**NAI**”). To make choices about the use of information from or about you for online behavioral or interest-based advertising on websites (desktop and mobile browsers), please visit the [DAA](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) and the [NAI](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1).

We may still use your data (in a way that doesn’t constitute as “sale” under the CCPA) to deliver contextual advertising, conduct cross-device tracking to serve you first-party ads directly, or for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as attribution and analytics.
