In the preceding twelve (12) months, the Company has disclosed the following categories of Personal Information for a business purpose:

- Category A: Identifiers;
- Category  F. Internet or other similar network activity; and 
- Category G. Geolocation data.

We disclose your Personal Information for a business purpose to the following categories of third parties: service providers & data aggregators (e.g., for analytics purposes and advertisement purposes) and business partners (e.g., payment processors).

When we disclose Personal Information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.

## (D) SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

The CCPA broadly defines “sale” of personal information, beyond how you might commonly interpret those terms, as such, the definition may include allowing third parties to receive certain information and create a profile about your device, browser, or you (also known as “Interest-Based Advertising”). The term “sell” is defined to include not just selling in exchange for money, but also sharing or transferring personal information (including information that does not directly identify an individual as described above) in exchange for anything of value, which is not limited to the exchange of money.

Certain brands feature interest-based advertising. Advertising, including interested-based advertising, enables these our brands to provide you with the Apps and Services for free (in certain Apps, you will be able to use the Paid Services which shall be ad free).

As stated above, the CCPA broadly defines “sale” of Personal Information in a way that may include allowing third parties to receive certain information to add to a profile about your device, browser, or you. This profile enables interest-based advertising on our App and other online services. In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have sold Personal Information: 

- Category A. Identifiers;
- Category F. Internet or other similar network activity; and 
- Category G. Geolocation data.

We have sold the such Personal Information to our partner, the advertisers, for the purpose of placing personalized advertisement on our App or Services.
